Congratulations! You have completed the Prototype of this game!
This was made over the course of around a month, but would have been faster if not for major events, including a hurricane.
This prototype contains the basic features of this game, and more is to come!
I hope you enjoyed! Now, you can mess around in this room if you want, but there is nothing else here.
